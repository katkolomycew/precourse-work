Precourse Work — September 2019 (_nology)

A month before starting the _nology course in September, we were sent a file of four challenges to complete at home as well as to record our progress throughout. This repository includes the last challenge — to build a website using the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which we learned individually through online articles and tutorials.

I completed this challenge over five days, usually learning new concepts in the mornings and applying them in the afternoons and evenings. While the hardest area for me was grasping certain rules of CSS such as positions within layouts, my favourite part was the creative freedom and learning how and why some things in code work and others did not.
