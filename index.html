            <strong>1997 - 2006 | GOOD OL' POLAND ERA</strong>
            <br>I don't remember much about this part of my life besides climbing
            trees, chasing (and being chased by) wasps, and destroying my ankles
            with one of those metal scooters. I also finished two years of
            Polish primary school, where I learned important English words like
            "teddy bear."
            <br><strong>2006 - 2015 | NEW SCOTLAND CHAPTER</strong>
            <br>So much education! I finished Scottish primary school and
            high school, during which I mastered English
            and picked up Spanish along the way. But everyone knows that high
            school is a weird time, so we don't really talk about high school.
            <br><strong>2015 - 2019 | AND SUDDENLY I'M AN ADULT</strong>
            <br>Even more education, occassionaly interrupted by work and travel.
            I graduated from university, conquered the Western side of Europe and
            a whole other continent, worked as a teacher in Spain, became a Team
            Leader in a hotel after two months of working there, then eventually said
            goodbyes to friends leaving Scotland while realising that I will be
            leaving soon too. 
            <br><strong>SEPTEMBER 2019 | SO NOW WHAT?</strong>
            <br>Well, let's find out...
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="textbox6">
        <h2><a name="exactline5">Me & _nology</a></h2>
        <p>
            My adventure with tech started when I was old enough to
            sorta-kinda understand Windows XP (but when I was still too young to stay 
            home alone). My dad usually always took me to work, to a company whose
            entire IT sector depended on his skills. So there I was, a small girl in
            the big new world of HTML and CSS and JavaScript, watching magic happen on
            a computer screen.
            <br>A decade later I found myself on Tumblr watching the same magic –
            but this time the computer screen was a lot flatter, and I was the
            magician. I read and corrected code templates more often than wrote them,
            but I was still in love with the job, and now I was also realising
            something else.
            <br><i>Technology will always be everywhere.</i>
            <br>It had been present in the company my dad used to work for almost 20
            years ago, it was present in the building blocks of the new social media
            sites that were suddenly taking over, and it will be present in another
            decade when apps and codes and computers play a role in every 
            industry.
            <br>It's inevitable, and I applied to _nology so I could be a part of
            it once it happens – to master another language, to use it for 
            making a change rather than observing it, and to collaborate with 
            people who want this change to be positive for the world.
            <br>And you know, I also just want to be able to say that I'm a
            professional full-time nerd.
